In alignment with security compliance standards, the Nautilus project team has opted to impose restrictions on crontab access. Specifically,
only designated users will be permitted to create or update cron jobs.
Configure crontab access on App Server 3 as follows: Allow crontab access to mariyam user while denying access to the rod user.

Ans:- 
To configure crontab access on App Server 3, you can follow similar steps as before using the cron.allow and cron.deny files. Here are the steps:

Allow crontab access to the mariyam user:

Open the cron.allow file using a text editor:
sudo nano /etc/cron.allow
Add the mariyam user to the file:
mariyam
Save and close the file.
Deny crontab access to the rod user:

Open the cron.deny file using a text editor:
sudo nano /etc/cron.deny
Add the rod user to the file:
rod
Save and close the file.
These steps will ensure that only the mariyam user can create or update cron jobs, while the rod user will be denied access.
