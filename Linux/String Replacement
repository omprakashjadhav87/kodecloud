within the Stratos DC, the backup server holds template XML files crucial for the Nautilus application. Before utilization, these files require
valid data insertion. As part of routine maintenance, system admins at xFusionCorp Industries employ string and file manipulation commands.

Your task is to substitute all occurrences of the string Text with Submarine within the XML file located at /root/nautilus.xml on the backup
 server.

Ans:- 

To substitute all occurrences of the string "Text" with "Submarine" within the XML file located at /root/nautilus.xml on the backup server, you can use the sed command. Here is the command you need to run:

sudo sed -i 's/Text/Submarine/g' /root/nautilus.xml

This command will:
sudo: Run the command with superuser privileges.
sed: Stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
-i: Edit the file in place.
's/Text/Submarine/g': Substitute all occurrences of "Text" with "Submarine" globally in the file.
/root/nautilus.xml: The path to the XML file.
