Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter:



Install the required SELinux packages.

Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled

Ans:- 

Here are the steps to install and configure SELinux on App server 1 in the Stratos Datacenter:

Install SELinux Packages:

sudo yum install selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted
Permanently Disable SELinux:

Open the SELinux configuration file:
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config
Change the SELINUX directive to disabled:
SELINUX=disabled
Verify the Configuration:

Check the current SELinux status (it will still show as enabled until the reboot):
sestatus
After the scheduled maintenance reboot, SELinux will be disabled as required.
