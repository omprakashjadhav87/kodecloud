To synchronize the timezone settings across the Nautilus Application Servers to match the local datacenter's timezone (Pacific/Port_Moresby), you can follow these steps:

Connect to each server:

Use SSH to connect to each Nautilus Application Server.
Check the current timezone:

Run the command:
timedatectl
This will display the current timezone settings.
Set the timezone to Pacific/Port_Moresby:

Run the command:
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Pacific/Port_Moresby
Verify the change:

Run the command again to ensure the timezone has been updated:
timedatectl
Repeat for all servers:

Ensure you perform these steps on each server in the Stratos Datacenter.
