The Nautilus DevOps team is practicing some of the Ansible modules and creating and testing different Ansible playbooks to accomplish tasks. Recently they started testing an Ansible file
module to create soft links on all app servers. Below you can find more details about it.
Write a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host, an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. Using this playbook
accomplish below given tasks:
Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner and group owner should be tony. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.
Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner and group owner should be steve. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.
Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner and group owner should be banner. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.
Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

Solutions:
create the playbook under below path
📁 /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml

---
- name: Create soft links and files per server
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

    - name: Create directory /opt/itadmin
      file:
        path: /opt/itadmin
        state: directory
        owner: "{{ file_owner }}"
        group: "{{ file_owner }}"
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Create empty file in /opt/itadmin
      file:
        path: "/opt/itadmin/{{ file_name }}"
        state: touch
        owner: "{{ file_owner }}"
        group: "{{ file_owner }}"
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Create symbolic link /var/www/html -> /opt/itadmin
      file:
        src: /opt/itadmin
        dest: /var/www/html
        state: link

  vars:
    file_name: "{{ lookup('vars', 'filename_map')[inventory_hostname] }}"
    file_owner: "{{ lookup('vars', 'owner_map')[inventory_hostname] }}"
    filename_map:
      stapp01: blog.txt
      stapp02: story.txt
      stapp03: media.txt
    owner_map:
      stapp01: tony
      stapp02: steve
      stapp03: banner

🚀 To Run It ( From Jump host)
Make sure your inventory file includes stapp01, stapp02, and stapp03, then execute:

ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
