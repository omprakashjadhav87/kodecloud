Create an inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host and add all app servers in it.
Create an Ansible playbook /home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml to install httpd package on all  app servers using Ansible yum module.
Make sure user thor should be able to run the playbook on jump host.
Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

Solutions:-

Step 1: Create the Inventory File
Open a terminal on the jump host.
Create the inventory file at /home/thor/playbook/inventory and add all app servers to it. For example:


[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n

Step 2: Create the Ansible Playbook
Create the playbook file at /home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml with the following content:


---
 - name: Install httpd on all app servers
   hosts: app_servers
   become: yes
   tasks:
     - name: Install httpd package
       yum:
         name: httpd
         state: present
 ```

Generate a SSH key on Jump Host . Please note it should Thor user.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048

Copy SSH key to all servers setup password-less authentication to the host
ssh-copy-id  tony@stapp01

Run the Playbook
Execute the playbook using the command:

ansible-playbook -i /home/thor/playbook/inventory /home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml

This setup should allow user thor to run the playbook on the jump host without needing to pass any extra arguments.
