The Nautilus DevOps team is testing various Ansible modules on servers in Stratos DC. They're currently focusing on file creation on remote hosts using Ansible. Here are the details:


a. Create an inventory file ~/playbook/inventory on jump host and include all app servers.


b. Create a playbook ~/playbook/playbook.yml to create a blank file /opt/code.txt on all app servers.


c. Set the permissions of the /opt/code.txt file to 0655.


d. Ensure the user/group owner of the /opt/code.txt file is tony on app server 1, steve on app server 2 and banner on app server 3.

Ans:- 

Genrate SSH key

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

copy ssh id to all server

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tony@172.16.238.10
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub steve@172.16.238.11
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub banner@172.16.238.12

Create inventory file:

stapp01 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n 
stapp02 ansible_user=steve ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@
stapp03 ansible_user=banner ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n


Create playbook.yml:

- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Create empty file
    file:
      path: /opt/code.txt
      state: touch
      owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
      mode: "0655"
