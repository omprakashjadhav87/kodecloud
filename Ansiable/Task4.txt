Copy Data to App Servers using Ansible

The Nautilus DevOps team needs to copy data from the jump host to all application servers in Stratos DC using Ansible. Execute the task with the following details:


a. Create an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump_host and add all application servers as managed nodes.


b. Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml on the jump host to copy the /usr/src/security/index.html file to all application servers, placing it at /opt/security.


Note: Validation will run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook functions properly without any extra arguments.
