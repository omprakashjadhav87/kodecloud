Configure Default SSH User for Ansible.

The Nautilus DevOps team aims to manage all servers within the stack using Ansible, utilizing a common sudo user across all servers. They plan to use this user for various tasks on each server. While this isn't finalized, they're starting with testing. Ansible is already installed on the jump host via yum. Here's the requirement:


On the jump host, modify the default configuration of Ansible to enable the use of siva as the default SSH user for all hosts. Ensure to make changes within Ansible's default configuration without creating a new one.

Ans:- 

To configure Ansible to use siva as the default SSH user for all hosts, you need to modify the Ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg). Here are the steps to do this:

Open the Ansible configuration file:

sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
Locate the [defaults] section: This section contains the default settings for Ansible.

Add or modify the remote_user setting: Ensure the following line is present under the [defaults] section:

[defaults]
remote_user = siva
Save and close the file.

This configuration will set siva as the default SSH user for all Ansible operations. If you need to override this setting for specific playbooks or hosts, you can do so within the playbook or inventory file.
