Use an appropriate provisioner to create a file named provisioner.txt containing the text "Provisioning successful". This file should be created after the creation of a null resource called local_null_resource on the instance where Terraform apply is run.


Note: Name the Terraform configuration file as local.tf.

Ans

Within the terraform-projects folder, create the following local.tf file:

resource "null_resource" "local_null_resource" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Provisioning successful' > provisioner.txt"
  }
}

Initialize the directory:

terraform init
And apply the configuration:

terraform apply
