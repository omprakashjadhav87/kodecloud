We have created a new EC2 instance tagged CLI-Instance using the AWS CLI.

Create a file named data.tf which defines an output called nontf_instance_ip. The value of the output should be the display name of this EC2 instance.


Note: The instance has not been created using Terraform.

data "aws_instance" "new_instance" {

}

output "nontf_instance_ip" {
  value = data.aws_instance.new_instance.public_ip
