The Nautilus DevOps team is currently engaged in a cleanup process, focusing on removing unnecessary data and services from their AWS account. As part of the migration process, several 
resources were created for one-time use only, necessitating a cleanup effort to optimize their AWS environment.
A S3 bucket named nautilus-bck-3562 already exists.
1) Copy the contents of nautilus-bck-3562 S3 bucket to /opt/s3-backup/ directory on terraform-client host (the landing host once you load this lab).
2) Delete the S3 bucket nautilus-bck-3562.
3) Use the AWS CLI through Terraform to accomplish this taskâ€”for example, by running AWS CLI commands within Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. 
Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to accomplish this task.
Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

# Copy S3 bucket contents to local backup directory
resource "null_resource" "copy_s3_backup" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws s3 cp s3://nautilus-bck-3562 /opt/s3-backup/ --recursive"
  }
}

# Delete S3 bucket after copying the contents
resource "null_resource" "delete_s3_bucket" {
  depends_on = [null_resource.copy_s3_backup]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws s3 rb s3://nautilus-bck-3562 --force"
