Create Security Group Using Terraform
Use Terraform to create a security group under the default VPC with the following requirements:

1) The name of the security group must be nautilus-sg.

2) The description must be Security group for Nautilus App Servers.

3) Add an inbound rule of type HTTP, with a port range of 80, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.

4) Add another inbound rule of type SSH, with a port range of 22, and source CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0.

Ensure that the security group is created in the us-east-1 region using Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file 
(do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Solutions:- 

create a file named main.tf with the following content:

vi main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}

resource "aws_security_group" "nautilus_sg" {
  name        = "nautilus-sg"
  description = "Security group for Nautilus App Servers"
  vpc_id      = data.aws_vpc.default.id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }


  tags = {
    Name = "nautilus-sg"
  }
}

Initialize the Terraform working directory:

terraform init

Review the execution plan: This shows what Terraform will do before making any changes.

terraform plan

Apply the configuration: This will create the security group as defined.

terraform apply
