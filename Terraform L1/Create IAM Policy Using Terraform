When establishing infrastructure on the AWS cloud, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is among the first and most critical services to configure. IAM facilitates the creation
and management of user accounts, groups, roles, policies, and other access controls. The Nautilus DevOps team is currently in the process of configuring these resources and has outlined 
the following requirements.
Create an IAM policy named iampolicy_siva in us-east-1 region using Terraform. It must allow read-only access to the EC2 console, i.e., this policy must allow users to view all instances,
AMIs, and snapshots in the Amazon EC2 console.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.
Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:-

 Terraform code you can paste into your main.tf file inside the /home/bob/terraform directory:


resource "aws_iam_policy" "iampolicy_siva" {
  name        = "iampolicy_siva"
  description = "IAM policy to allow read-only access to EC2 console"
  policy      = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow",
        Action = [
          "ec2:DescribeInstances",
          "ec2:DescribeImages",
          "ec2:DescribeSnapshots"
        ],
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}


Save this code in a file named main.tf in your Terraform working directory.
Run the following commands in your terminal:
cd /home/bob/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
