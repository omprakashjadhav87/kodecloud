The Nautilus DevOps team is automating IAM user creation using Terraform for better identity management.
For this task, create an AWS IAM User using Terraform with the following requirements:
The IAM User name iamuser_kirsty should be stored in a variable named KKE_user.
Note:
1. The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.
2. The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.
Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

solutions:- 

vi variables.tf

variable "KKE_user" {
  description = "iamuser_kirsty"
  type        = string
  default     = "iamuser_kirsty"
}


vi main.tf

resource "aws_iam_user" "kke_user" {
  name = var.KKE_user
}
