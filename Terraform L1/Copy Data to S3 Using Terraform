The Nautilus DevOps team is presently immersed in data migrations, transferring data from on-premise storage systems to AWS S3 buckets. They have recently received some data that they intend to copy to one of the S3 buckets.

S3 bucket named xfusion-cp-8496 already exists. Copy the file /tmp/xfusion.txt to s3 bucket xfusion-cp-8496 using Terraform. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.
Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:- 

To copy a local file like /tmp/xfusion.txt to an existing S3 bucket using Terraform, youâ€™ll need to use the aws_s3_object resource. Here's how you can modify your existing main.tf in
/home/bob/terraform:

resource "aws_s3_object" "upload_file" {
  bucket = "xfusion-cp-8496"
  key    = "xfusion.txt"
  source = "/tmp/xfusion.txt"
  etag   = filemd5("/tmp/xfusion.txt")
}

Once your main.tf is updated, follow these steps in the terminal:

cd /home/bob/terraform
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
