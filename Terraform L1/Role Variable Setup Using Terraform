The Nautilus DevOps team is automating IAM role creation using Terraform to streamline permissions management. As part of this task, they need to create an IAM role with specific requirements.

For this task, create an AWS IAM role using Terraform with the following requirements:

The IAM role name iamrole_javed should be stored in a variable named KKE_iamrole.
Note:

1. The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

2. The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.
The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

solutions:- 

vi variables.tf

variable "KKE_iamrole" {
  type = string
  description = "IAM role for KKE"
  default = "iamrole_javed"
}
vi main.tf

resource "aws_iam_role" "KKE_iamrole" {
  name = var.KKE_iamrole
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "eks.amazonaws.com"
        }
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      }
    ]
  })
}
