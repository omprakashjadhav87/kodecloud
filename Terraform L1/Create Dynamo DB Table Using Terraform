The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up a DynamoDB table for storing user data. They need to create a DynamoDB table with the following specifications:

1) The table name should be xfusion-users.

2) The primary key should be xfusion_id (String).

3) The table should use PAY_PER_REQUEST billing mode.

Use Terraform to create this DynamoDB table. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to create the DynamoDB 
table.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:- 

Then create the main.tf file using:
Paste the following Terraform configuration:

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "xfusion-users" {
  name           = "xfusion-users"
  billing_mode   = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key       = "xfusion_id"

attribute {
    name = "xfusion_id"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "xfusion_id"
    type = "S"
  }
  
  }
