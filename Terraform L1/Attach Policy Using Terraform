The Nautilus DevOps team has been creating a couple of services on AWS cloud. They have been breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. Recently they came up with requirements mentioned below.

An IAM user named iamuser_mariyam and a policy named iampolicy_mariyam already exists. Use Terraform to attach the IAM policy iampolicy_mariyam to the IAM user iamuser_mariyam. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to attach the specified IAM policy to the IAM user.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:- 

To attach the existing IAM policy iampolicy_mariyam to the IAM user iamuser_mariyam using Terraform, you'll need to update the main.tf file by adding an aws_iam_user_policy_attachment resource. Hereâ€™s how you can modify your Terraform configuration:

# Attach IAM policy to IAM user
resource "aws_iam_user_policy_attachment" "attach_policy" {
  user       = aws_iam_user.user.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.policy.arn
}
