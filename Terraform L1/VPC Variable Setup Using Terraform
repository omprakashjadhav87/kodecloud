The Nautilus DevOps team is automating VPC creation using Terraform to manage networking efficiently. As part of this task, they need to create a VPC with specific requirements.

For this task, create an AWS VPC using Terraform with the following requirements:

The VPC name datacenter-vpc should be stored in a variable named KKE_vpc.

The VPC should have a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.

Note:

The configuration values should be stored in a variables.tf file.

The Terraform script should be structured with a main.tf file referencing variables.tf.

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:- 

Create variables.tf
Inside your project directory, create a variables.tf file with the following content:

variable "KKE_vpc" {
  description = "The name of the VPC"
  type        = string
  default     = "datacenter-vpc"
}

variable "vpc_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for the VPC"
  type        = string
  default     = "10.0.0.0/16"
}


Create main.tf
Then in main.tf, define your VPC using those variables:

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block           = var.vpc_cidr
  tags = {
    Name = var.KKE_vpc
  }
}
