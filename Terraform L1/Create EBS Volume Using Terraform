The Nautilus DevOps team is strategizing the migration of a portion of their infrastructure to the AWS cloud. Recognizing the scale of this undertaking, they have opted to 
approach the migration in incremental steps rather than as a single massive transition. To achieve this, they have segmented large tasks into smaller, more manageable units. 
This granular approach enables the team to execute the migration in gradual phases, ensuring smoother implementation and minimizing disruption to ongoing operations. By breaking down the
migration into smaller tasks, the Nautilus DevOps team can systematically progress through each stage, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout
the migration process.

For this task, create an AWS EBS volume using Terraform with the following requirements:

Name of the volume should be datacenter-volume.

Volume type must be gp3.

Volume size must be 2 GiB.

Ensure the volume is created in us-east-1.


The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Create the main.tf file (do not create a different .tf file) to accomplish this task.

Note: Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Solutions:-

Here's the content you can place in your main.tf file to create the AWS EBS volume as specified:

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "datacenter-volume" {
  availability_zone = "us-west-1a"
  size              = 2 GiB
  type              = "gp3"
  
tags = {
    Name = "datacenter-volume"
  }
}

Open a text editor and paste the above content into a file named main.tf inside that directory.
Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:

cd /home/bob/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
