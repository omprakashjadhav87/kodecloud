Task 1. The Nautilus DevOps team aims to containerize various applications following a recent meeting with the application development team. They intend to conduct testing with the following steps: Install docker-ce and docker compose packages on App Server 1. Initiate the docker service.

Install Docker Engine on RHEL.

Set up the repository Install the dnf-plugins-core package (which provides the commands to manage your DNF repositories) and set up the repository. sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo Install Docker Engine Install the Docker packages.

Latest Specific version

To install the latest version, run: sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin If prompted to accept the GPG key, verify that the fingerprint matches 060A 61C5 1B55 8A7F 742B 77AA C52F EB6B 621E 9F35, and if so, accept it.

This command installs Docker, but it doesn't start Docker. It also creates a docker group, however, it doesn't add any users to the group by default.

Start Docker Engine. sudo systemctl enable --now docker This configures the Docker systemd service to start automatically when you boot your system. If you don't want Docker to start automatically, use sudo systemctl start docker instead.

On Linux To download and install the Docker Compose standalone, run:

curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.32.4/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Apply executable permissions to the standalone binary in the target path for the installation.

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Test and execute Docker Compose commands using docker-compose.
