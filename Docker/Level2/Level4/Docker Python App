A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 3.

We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 3.

Further complete this task as per details mentioned below: Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory: Use any python image as the base image. 

nstall the dependencies using requirements.txt file. 

 Expose the port 5003. Run the server.py script using CMD. Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile. 
 
 Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus: Map port 5003 of the container to the host port 8093. Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App 
 
 Server 3. curl http://localhost:8093/

Solutions:- 


üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Create the Dockerfile
Create the file at /python_app/Dockerfile with the following content:

Dockerfile
# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy source code and requirements
COPY src/ /app/

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 5003
EXPOSE 5003

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
üß± Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Run this from the /python_app directory:


cd /python_app
docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
üöÄ Step 3: Run the Container

docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8093:5003 nautilus/python-app
This maps host port 8093 to container port 5003, as required.

‚úÖ Step 4: Test the Deployment

curl http://localhost:8093/
