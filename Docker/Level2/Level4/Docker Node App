There is a requirement to Dockerize a Node app and to deploy the same on App Server 3. Under /node_app directory on App Server 3, we have already placed a package.json 
file that describes the app dependencies and server.js file that defines a web app framework.

Create a Dockerfile (name is case sensitive) under /node_app directory:

Use any node image as the base image.
Install the dependencies using package.json file.
Use server.js in the CMD.
Expose port 5001.

The build image should be named as nautilus/node-web-app.


Now run a container named nodeapp_nautilus using this image.

Map the container port 5001 with the host port 8096.

. Once deployed, you can test the app using a curl command on App Server 3:



curl http://localhost:8096

Solutions:- 

üõ†Ô∏è Step 1: Create the Dockerfile
Navigate to /node_app and create a file named Dockerfile (case-sensitive):


cd /node_app
Then create the file with the following content:

Dockerfile
# Use Node.js base image
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app files
COPY server.js ./

# Expose port 5001
EXPOSE 5001

# Start the app
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

üß± Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Run this command from the /node_app directory:
docker build -t nautilus/node-web-app .

üöÄ Step 3: Run the Container
Now deploy the container with port mapping:
docker run -d --name nodeapp_nautilus -p 8096:5001 nautilus/node-web-app

‚úÖ Step 4: Test the DeploymentUse curl to verify the app is running:
curl http://localhost:8096
