One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container.
A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:
a. Create an image blog:nautilus on Application Server 1 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

Ans:-

 I can help with that! Here are the steps to create a new Docker image from the running container ubuntu_latest on Application Server 1:

Log in to Application Server 1:

ssh user@application_server_1

Check the running containers to ensure ubuntu_latest is running:
docker ps

Commit the running container ubuntu_latest to a new image blog:nautilus:
docker commit ubuntu_latest blog:nautilus

Verify the new image has been created:

docker images

This will create a new Docker image blog:nautilus from the current state of the ubuntu_latest container.
