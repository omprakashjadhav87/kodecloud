The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which is supposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the 
team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:

a. On App Server  1 in Stratos DC pull nginx image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).
b. Create a new container with name apps from the image you just pulled.
c. Map the host volume /opt/data with container volume /tmp. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/data. Also please keep the container
in running state.

Solutions:-
Step A: Pull the Nginx Docker image
docker pull nginx:latest

Before creating the container, make sure the host directory exists:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/data

Now copy the file:
sudo cp /tmp/sample.txt /opt/data/

Verify file prest or not .
cd /opt/data/
ls
sample.txt

Then start the container with volume mapping:

docker run -d \
  --name apps \
  -v /opt/data:/tmp/ \
  nginx:latest
  
  You can verify everything is in place with:
  docker ps
  docker exec apps ls /tmp
