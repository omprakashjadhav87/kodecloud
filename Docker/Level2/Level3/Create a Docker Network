The Nautilus DevOps team needs to set up several docker environments for different applications. One of the team members has been assigned a ticket where he has been asked to create
some docker networks to be used later. Complete the task based on the following ticket description:

a. Create a docker network named as ecommerce on App Server 2 in Stratos DC.
b. Configure it to use macvlan drivers.
c. Set it to use subnet 192.168.30.0/24 and iprange 192.168.30.0/24.

Solutions:- 

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Create a Macvlan Docker Network

docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.30.0/24 \
  --ip-range=192.168.30.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.30.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 \
  ecommerce

Once created, you can confirm the network using:

docker network ls
docker network inspect ecommerce
