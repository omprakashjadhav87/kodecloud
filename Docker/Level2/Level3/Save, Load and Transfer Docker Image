One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with 
name ecommerce:datacenter. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

a. On App Server 1 save the image ecommerce:datacenter in an archive.
b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.
c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.
Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.

Solutions:-
üß∞ Step-by-Step Instructions
a. Save the image on App Server 1

docker save -o /tmp/ecommerce.tar ecommerce:datacenter

b. Transfer the archive to App Server 3
Use scp or rsync to copy the file:

scp /tmp/ecommerce_datacenter.tar banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp/

c. Load the image on App Server 3

docker load -i /tmp/ecommerce_datacenter.tar
This will restore the image with the same name and tag (ecommerce:datacenter).
