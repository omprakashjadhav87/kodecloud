The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared details with 
the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:

a. On App Server 2 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).
b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.
c. Map 80 number port of container with port 5000 of docker host.
d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/devops volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

Solutions:- 

üóÇÔ∏è File Path: Save this as /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml exactly as instructed.

version: '3.8'

services:
  webserver:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    volumes:
      - /opt/devops:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs

Once it's saved, you can deploy it with ( Docker Compose)

Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version

If that works, just switch your command to:
cd /opt/docker

docker-compose up -d
