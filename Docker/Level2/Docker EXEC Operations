One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP.
Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:
a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Configure Apache to listen on port 8085 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on
localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc.
c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end.

Ans:-
 I can guide you through the steps to complete the pending work on the kkloud container. Here’s what you need to do:

Access the kkloud container on App Server 3:
ssh user@appserver3
docker exec -it kkloud /bin/bash

Install Apache2: Inside the container, update the package list and install Apache2:
apt update
apt install apache2 -y

Configure Apache to listen on port 8085: Open the Apache configuration file and change the listening port:
sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 8085/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf
sed -i 's/:80/:8085/' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Restart Apache to apply changes:
service apache2 restart

Verify Apache is running on port 8085: Check the status of Apache and ensure it’s listening on the correct port:
service apache2 status
netstat -tuln | grep 8085

Keep the container running: Ensure the container remains in a running state:
exit
docker ps

These steps should help you complete the configuration and ensure Apache is running correctly on the specified port.
