As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements
are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 2 in Stratos DC and configure
to build an image with the following requirements:
a. Use ubuntu as the base image.
b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6000 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).
Ans:-
Sure, here's a Dockerfile that meets the requirements:

vi Dockerfile.

# Use ubuntu as the base image
FROM ubuntu:latest

# Install apache2
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apache2

# Configure apache2 to work on port 6000
RUN sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 6000/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf

# Expose port 6000
EXPOSE 6000

# Start apache2 service
CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]

This Dockerfile will create an image based on Ubuntu, install Apache2, configure it to listen on port 6000, and start the Apache2 service when the container runs.

To run the Dockerfile and build the image, follow these steps:

Navigate to the directory where your Dockerfile is located:

cd /opt/docker

Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile:
docker build -t my-apache-image .
This command will create an image named my-apache-image.

Run a container from the image:
docker run -d -p 6000:6000 my-apache-image
This command will start a container from the my-apache-image and map port 6000 on your host to port 6000 in the container.

You should now have Apache running on port 6000 in your Docker container.
