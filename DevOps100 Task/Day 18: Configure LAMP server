xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host a WordPress website on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. They have already done infrastructure configurationâ€”for example, on the storage server they
already have a shared directory /vaw/www/html that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
a. Install httpd, php and its dependencies on all app hosts.
b. Apache should serve on port 3000 within the apps.
c. Install/Configure MariaDB server on DB Server.
d. Create a database named kodekloud_db2 and create a database user named kodekloud_pop identified as password B4zNgHA7Ya. Further make sure this newly created user is able to perform all 
operation on the database you created.
e. Finally you should be able to access the website on LBR link, by clicking on the App button on the top bar. You should see a message like App is able to connect to the database using user 
kodekloud_pop.
