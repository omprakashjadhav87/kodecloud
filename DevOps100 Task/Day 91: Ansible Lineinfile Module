The Nautilus DevOps team want to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. They also want to deploy a sample web page using Ansible. Therefore, 
write the required playbook to complete this task as per details mentioned below.

We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Write a playbook playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself. 
Using the playbook perform below given tasks:


Install httpd web server on all app servers, and make sure its service is up and running.


Create a file /var/www/html/index.html with content:


This is a Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!


Using lineinfile Ansible module add some more content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries!


Also make sure this new line is added at the top of the file.


The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.


The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any
extra arguments.
