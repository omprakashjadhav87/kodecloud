The Nautilus application development team shared static website content that needs to be hosted on the httpd web server using a containerised platform. The team has shared
details with the DevOps team, and we need to set up an environment according to those guidelines. Below are the details:
a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC create a container named httpd using a docker compose file /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml (please use the exact name for file).
b. Use httpd (preferably latest tag) image for container and make sure container is named as httpd; you can use any name for service.
c. Map 80 number port of container with port 3003 of docker host.
d. Map container's /usr/local/apache2/htdocs volume with /opt/devops volume of docker host which is already there. (please do not modify any data within these locations).

Solutions:- 

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions
Log into App Server 3 If you're not already on it, SSH into the server:


ssh user@appserver3
Navigate to the Docker Compose directory

cd /opt/docker

create docker-compose.yml file

version: '3.8'

services:
  webserver:
    image: httpd:latest
    container_name: httpd
    ports:
      - "3003:80"
    volumes:
      - /opt/devops:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs:ro

Install docker compose .
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

running it directly like this:
/usr/local/bin/docker-compose up -d

üåê Test the app.
curl http://localhost:3003
You should see the static website content served from /opt/devops.

Run the Docker Compose file


docker-compose up -d


Verify the container is running


docker ps
You should see a container named httpd with the correct port mapping.

Test the setup From the host machine, run:
