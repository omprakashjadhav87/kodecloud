xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 3.
b. Apache should serve on port 6200.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/blog and /home/thor/demo on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that blog should work on the link http://localhost:6200/blog/ and 
demo should work on link http://localhost:6200/demo/ on the mentioned app server.
d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:6200/blog/ and curl http://localhost:6200/demo/

Solutions:- 

Step-by-Step Instructions
a. Install Apache (httpd) on App Server 3

b. Configure Apache to Serve on Port 6200
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Replace it with: Listen 6200

c. Transfer Website Backups from Jump Host

# Copy to temporary location on App Server 3
scp -r /home/thor/blog banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp/
scp -r /home/thor/demo banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp/

Then SSH into App Server 3 and move them to the final destination:
ssh banner@172.16.238.12

# Move from temp to Apache's web root
sudo mv /tmp/blog /var/www/html/
sudo mv /tmp/demo /var/www/html/

âœ… Final Check

Run this on App Server 3 to confirm:
curl http://localhost:6200/blog/
curl http://localhost:6200/demo/
