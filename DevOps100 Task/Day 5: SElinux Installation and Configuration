Following a security audit, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements
have been established for App server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter:

Install the required SELinux packages.

Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.

Solution:-

🛠️ Step 1: Install SELinux Packages
On Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS or RHEL), use:


sudo yum install -y selinux-policy selinux-policy-targeted

🔧 Step 2: Permanently Disable SELinux
sudo vi /etc/selinux/config

Set the following line:
SELINUX=disabled


✅ Step 4: Verify Configuration.
grep SELINUX= /etc/selinux/config

Expected output:
SELINUX=disabled
