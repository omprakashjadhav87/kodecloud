üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Fix for MariaDB Service Downtime

MariaDB is trying to write a test file to /var/lib/mysql during startup to verify it has proper access‚Äîbut it‚Äôs failing, which usually means permission or ownership issues on the data directory.

Check Ownership
ls -ld /var/lib/mysql

If it‚Äôs not owned by mysql:mysql, fix it:

chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql

Check Permissions
chmod 755 /var/lib/mysql

verify SELinux Isn‚Äôt Blocking Access Since you‚Äôve worked with SELinux before, you can test quickly:
setenforce 0
systemctl restart mariadb
