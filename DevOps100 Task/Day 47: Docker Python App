A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 1. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) 
under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 1. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:

Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:
Use any python image as the base image.
Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
Expose the port 8089.
Run the server.py script using CMD.

Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.
Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:
Map port 8089 of the container to the host port 8095.
Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 1.
curl http://localhost:8095/

Solutions:- 

Step 1: Create the Dockerfile
Create the file at /python_app/Dockerfile with the following content:

# Use official Python base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY src/requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the app
COPY src/ .

# Expose the app port
EXPOSE 8089

# Run the app
CMD ["python", "server.py"]

üõ† Step 2: Build the Docker Image
cd /python_app
docker build -t nautilus/python-app .

Step 3: Run the Container
docker run -d \
  --name pythonapp_nautilus \
  -p 8095:8089 \
  nautilus/python-app

üîç Step 4: Test the App
curl http://localhost:8095/
