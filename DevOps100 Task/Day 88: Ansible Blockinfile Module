The Nautilus DevOps team wants to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. Additionally, they want to deploy a sample web page for 
now using Ansible only. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.

We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.
Using the playbook, install httpd web server on all app servers. Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.
Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

Welcome to XfusionCorp!

This is  Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

Please do not modify this file manually!

The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.
The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0755 on all app servers.

Note:
i. Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.
ii. Do not use any custom or empty marker for blockinfile module.
