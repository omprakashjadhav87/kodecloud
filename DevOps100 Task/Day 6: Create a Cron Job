The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. 
Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.
b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Here’s how you can test cron job functionality step-by-step across all Nautilus app servers:

🛠️ Step A: Install cronie and start crond service

# Install cronie
sudo yum install -y cronie

# Enable and start the crond service
sudo systemctl enable crond
sudo systemctl start crond

# Verify the service status
sudo systemctl status crond

📅 Step B: Add the sample cron job
Add the job to root's crontab:

sudo crontab -l > temp_cron 2>/dev/null
echo "*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text" >> temp_cron
sudo crontab temp_cron
rm temp_cron

This will write “hello” to /tmp/cron_text every 5 minutes. To test it quicker, you can manually execute it:

sudo bash -c "echo hello > /tmp/cron_text"
