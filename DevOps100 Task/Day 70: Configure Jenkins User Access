1. Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login with username admin and password Adm!n321.
2. Create a jenkins user named rose with the passwordGyQkFRVNr3. Their full name should match Rose.
3. Utilize the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy to assign overall read permission to the rose user.
4. Remove all permissions for Anonymous users (if any) ensuring that the admin user retains overall Administer permissions.
