Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, 
the team aims to revert to the previous version.

There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

Solutions:-
