One of the DevOps engineers was trying to deploy a python app on Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, due to some mis-configuration, the application is not coming up. Please take a look into it and fix the issues.
Application should be accessible on the specified nodePort. The deployment name is python-deployment-nautilus, its using poroko/flask-demo-appimage. 
The deployment and service of this app is already deployed. nodePort should be 32345 and targetPort should be python flask app's default port.

Solutions:- 
1) to check current status of pods . (Image pullbackoff)

kubectl get pod 

edit deployment and fix correct image name as per task ( poroko/flask-demo-appimage)

kubectl edit deploy python-deployment-nautilus ( This should be deployment)
