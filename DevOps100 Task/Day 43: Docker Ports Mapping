The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. One of the tickets
has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Pull nginx:alpine-perl docker image on Application Server 3.
b. Create a container named games using the image you pulled.
c. Map host port 5003 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.

Solutions:- 

a. Pull the nginx:alpine-perl Docker image
docker pull nginx:alpine-perl

b. Create a container named games using the pulled image
docker run -d --name games -p 5003:80 nginx:alpine-perl

To confirm everything is working:
docker ps 

curl http://localhost:5003
You should get the default Nginx welcome page.
