The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, 
that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. Please find below more details about it.

Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:

a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

b. COMPANY and its value should be DevOps

c. GROUP and its value should be Industries

Use command ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"'] (please use this exact command), also set its restartPolicy policy to Never to avoid crash loop back.

You can check the output using kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting command.


Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Solutions:-

Hereâ€™s a complete Kubernetes manifest to create the pod print-envars-greeting with the specified environment variables and command. This setup ensures the pod runs once, prints the greeting, and exits cleanly.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
    - name: print-env-container
      image: bash
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"']
      env:
        - name: GREETING
          value: "Welcome to"
        - name: COMPANY
          value: "DevOps"
        - name: GROUP
          value: "Industries"
  restartPolicy: Never

ðŸš€ To Deploy:

kubectl apply -f pod-greeting.yaml

ðŸ“œ To View Output:
kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting

You should see:
Welcome to DevOps Industries
