Following security audits, the xFusionCorp Industries security team has rolled out new protocols, including the restriction of direct root SSH login.
Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

Solutions:-

Step-by-Step: Disable Root SSH Access
Log in to each app server

Use a non-root user with sudo privileges:


ssh user@<app-server-ip>
Edit the SSH daemon configuration

Open the SSH config file:


sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Locate the line:


#PermitRootLogin yes
Change it to:


PermitRootLogin no
This disables both password and key-based root login.

Restart the SSH service

Apply the changes:


sudo systemctl restart sshd
Verify the restriction

Try logging in as root:


ssh root@<app-server-ip>
You should see:
Permission denied
