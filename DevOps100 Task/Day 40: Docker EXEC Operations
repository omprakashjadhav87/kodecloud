One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. 
Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below:
a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Configure Apache to listen on port 8089 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1,
container ip, etc.
c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end.

Solutions:-

First, access the container:

docker exec -it kkloud 
Then update package lists and install Apache:


apt update
apt install apache2 -y
✅ b. Configure Apache to listen on port 8089
Edit the Apache ports configuration file:


sed -i 's/^Listen 80$/Listen 8089/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf
Also update the default site configuration:


sed -i 's/<VirtualHost \*:80>/<VirtualHost *:8089>/' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
This ensures Apache listens on all interfaces (localhost, 127.0.0.1, container IP, etc.) on port 8089.

✅ c. Start Apache and keep container running

Start the Apache service:
service apache2 start

Verify it's running:
ps aux | grep apache2
