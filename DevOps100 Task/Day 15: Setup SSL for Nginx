The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for 
application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 3.
2. On App Server 3 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the 
same in Nginx.
3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.
4. For final testing try to access the App Server 3 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.

Solutions:- 

Install and Start Nginx
yum install nginx -y

sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

2. Move SSL Certificate and Key

sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/private

sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/ssl/private/

Update permissions (optional but good practice):
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/certs/nautilus.crt
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/private/nautilus.key

⚙️ 3. Configure Nginx with SSL

sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl_site.conf

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nautilus.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nautilus.key;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}

Create Document Root
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html

echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html

Firewall Installed
installing iptables

yum install iptables-persistent

sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo service iptables save

Reload Nginx:
sudo systemctl reload nginx

Try
curl -Ik https://172.16.238.12/

Nginx binds correctly and listens on port 443, curl will give you that sweet HTTP/1.1 200 OK.
