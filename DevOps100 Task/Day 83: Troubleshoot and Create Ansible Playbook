An Ansible playbook needs completion on the jump host, where a team member left off. Below are the details:



The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory requires adjustments. The playbook must run on App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Update the inventory accordingly.


Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml. Include a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 2.


Note: Validation will run the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

Solutions:- 

Step 1: Generate SSH Key for thor
Run this on the jump host:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""

ðŸ“¤ Step 2: Copy Public Key to App Server 2 (stapp02)
Assuming steve is the correct user on stapp02, run:
ssh-copy-id -i /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub steve@172.16.238.11
