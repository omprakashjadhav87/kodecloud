The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media present on Storage server in Stratos DC. This was just a test repository 
and one of the developers just pushed a couple of changes for testing, but now they want to clean this repository along with the commit history/work tree, so they want to point back
the HEAD and the branch itself to a commit with message add data.txt file. Find below more details:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media git repository, reset the git commit history so that there are only two commits in the commit history i.e initial commit and add data.txt file.
Also make sure to push your changes.

ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Instructions
Go to the repository directory:
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/media

Find the commit hash of add data.txt file:
git log

Look for the commit with the message add data.txt file. Note down its hash (first few characters are enough).

Hard reset to that commit: Suppose the hash is abc123:
git reset --hard abc123

Clean up dangling commits and reflog:
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now

Force-push the changes to the remote:
git push origin HEAD --force
