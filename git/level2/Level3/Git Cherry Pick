The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/games.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with the DevOps team:
There are two branches in this repository, master and feature. One of the developers is working on the feature branch and their work is still in progress, however they want to merge 
one of the commits from the feature branch to the master branch, the message for the commit that needs to be merged into master is Update info.txt. Accomplish this task for them, also 
remember to push your changes eventually.

Solutions:-

âœ… Git Cherry-Pick Workflow Breakdown

Navigate to the repository subdirectory
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games/

Moves into the working repo (assumes .git exists in a parent folder).

List files to verify presence of expected content
ls

Check which branch you're on

git branch
Confirms current branch before switching.

List with timestamps for inspection
ls -lrt

Review current changes, if any
git status

View commit history (likely on current branch)
git log

Switch to the master branch
git checkout master

Double-check contents again, now from master
ls

Reconfirm branch (now should be master)
git branch

Cherry-pick the desired commit from feature branch
git cherry-pick <hash addres for file.info>
This pulls the Update info.txt commit onto master.


List tracked files after cherry-pick
git ls-files

Push the updated master branch to remote
git push
