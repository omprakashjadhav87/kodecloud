The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news present on Storage server in Stratos DC. One of the developers stashed some in-progress changes in this repository, but now they want to restore some of the stashed changes. Find below more details to accomplish this task:

Look for the stashed changes under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news git repository, and restore the stash with stash@{1} identifier. Further, commit and push your changes to the origin.

Solutions:-

🧩 Step 1: Navigate to the Repository

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
🔍 Step 2: List All Stashed Changes (Just to Confirm)

git stash list
You'll see something like:
stash@{0}: WIP on master: e.g., abc123 Commit message
stash@{1}: WIP on master: e.g., def456 Another message
📥 Step 3: Apply Specific Stash (stash@{1})
git stash apply stash@{1}

✅ This brings back the changes saved in that stash into your working directory.

✅ Step 4: Add and Commit the Restored Changes

git add .
git commit -m "Restored changes from stash@{1}"

🚀 Step 5: Push Changes to Origin
git push origin master
