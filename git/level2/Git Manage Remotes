The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/blog.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog. 
Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote
on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog repository as per details mentioned below:
a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog repo add a new remote dev_blog and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_blog.git repository.
b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.
c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

Solutions:
here are the steps to update the Git repository as requested:

Add a new remote dev_blog:

 cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
 git remote add dev_blog /opt/xfusioncorp_blog.git
 ``
Copy the file /tmp/index.html to the repository and commit it:
 cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog/
 cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
 git add index.html
 git commit -m "Add index.html to master branch"
 ```
Push the master branch to the new remote dev_blog:
 git push dev_blog master
 ```

These commands will add the new remote, copy the file, commit the changes, and push the master branch to the new remote.
