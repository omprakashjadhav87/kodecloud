Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project. They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites
have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with. Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.
a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/games.git.
b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to the master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to the master branch in /opt/games.git repo.
c. Clone /opt/games.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games directory.
d. Create a new branch named xfusioncorp_games in repo that you cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory.
e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp directory on storage server itself; copy that to the repo, add/commit in the new branch you just created, and finally push your branch to the origin.
f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to the master directly as per the hook you have set up.

Solutions:- 

a. Install Git and Configure Global Settings
sudo yum install git -y  # or use apt if it's a Debian-based system
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

Create a bare repository:
cd /opt
git init --bare games.git

🛡️ b. Set Up Update Hook to Block Direct Pushes to master
Assuming the hook script is at /tmp/update:
scp /tmp/update /opt/games.git/hooks/update
chmod +x /opt/games.git/hooks/update

✅ This hook will now reject direct pushes to the master branch.
📦 c. Clone the Bare Repository
mkdir -p /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
git clone /opt/games.git games

🌿 d. Create a New Branch xfusioncorp_games
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games
git checkout -b xfusioncorp_games

📄 e. Add readme.md, Commit, and Push the Branch
cp /tmp/readme.md .
git add readme.md
git commit -m "Add readme.md to xfusioncorp_games branch"
git push origin xfusioncorp_games

🚫 f. Create master Branch and Test Hook
git checkout -b master
git push origin xfusioncorp_games
