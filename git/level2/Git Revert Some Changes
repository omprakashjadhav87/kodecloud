The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games present on Storage server in Stratos DC. 
However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. 
Below are more details about the task:

In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ).

Use revert games message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

Solutions:-

Navigate to the repository:

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games

Revert the latest commit:

View the commit history to identify the previous commit:
git log --oneline

Revert the latest commit using the commit hash of the previous commit:
git reset --hard <previous_commit_hash>

Create a new commit with the revert message:
git commit --allow-empty -m "revert games"

Push the changes to the remote repository:
git push origin main --force

This method will reset the repository to the state of the previous commit and create a new commit with the specified message.
