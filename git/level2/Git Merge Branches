The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/ecommerce.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
Create a new branch nautilus in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo.
Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. 
Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

Solutions:-

Navigate to the repository:

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce

Create a new branch nautilus from master:

git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b nautilus


Copy the index.html file into the repository:

cp /tmp/index.html .


Add and commit the file in the nautilus branch:

git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html to nautilus branch"


Merge the nautilus branch back into master:

git checkout master
git merge nautilus

Push the changes to the origin for both branches:

git push origin master
git push origin nautilus

These commands will help you create the new branch, add the file, commit the changes, merge the branch back into master, and push the changes to the remote repository.
