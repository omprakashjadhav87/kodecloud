During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:
a. On App Server 3 at location /var/www/html/media find out all files (not directories) having .css extension.
b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /media on same server.
c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/media directory content.

Ans:- 

Here's how you can accomplish this task using the find and cp commands in Linux:
Find all .css files in /var/www/html/media:
find /var/www/html/media -type f -name "*.css"

Copy these files along with their parent directory structure to /media:
find /var/www/html/media -type f -name "*.css" -exec sh -c 'mkdir -p /media/$(dirname "{}") && cp "{}" /media/{}' \;

This command does the following:
find /var/www/html/media -type f -name "*.css": Finds all files with a .css extension.
-exec sh -c 'mkdir -p /media/$(dirname "{}") && cp "{}" /media/{}' \;: For each found file, it creates the necessary directory structure in /media and then copies the file to the corresponding location.
Make sure to run these commands with appropriate permissions, possibly using sudo if required.
