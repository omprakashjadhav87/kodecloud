We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, 
and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 5003 and 8098, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. 
Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:
We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.

Sonlutions:-

I can help with that! Here are the steps to update the iptables rules to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port (8098) and block all incoming connections to Apache's port (5003), ensuring the rules are permanent:

Open a terminal on the backup server.

Add the iptables rules:

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8098 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 5003 -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j REJECT

Save the rules to make them permanent:
sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables

Verify the rules:
cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables

These commands will ensure that all incoming connections to Nginx's port are allowed, while incoming connections to Apache's port are blocked. The rules will persist across reboots.
