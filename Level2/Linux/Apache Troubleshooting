xFusionCorp Industries uses some monitoring tools to check the status of every service, application, etc running on the systems. Recently, the monitoring system identified that Apache service
is not running on some of the Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter.
1. Identify the faulty Nautilus Application Server and fix the issue. Also, make sure Apache service is up and running on all Nautilus Application Servers. 
Do not try to stop any kind of firewall that is already running.
2. Apache is running on 5004 port on all Nautilus Application Servers and its document root must be /var/www/html on all app servers.
3. Finally you can test from jump host using curl command to access Apache on all app servers and it should be reachable and you should get some static page. 
E.g. curl http://172.16.238.10:5004/.

Ans:- 

Step 1: Identify the Faulty Server
SSH into each Nautilus Application Server:

ssh user@<server-ip>

Check the status of the Apache service:
sudo systemctl status httpd

Enable the service to start on boot:
sudo systemctl enable httpd

# Verify Apache configuration
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# Ensure Listen 5004 and DocumentRoot "/var/www/html" are set

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart httpd

# Test from jump host
ssh user@jump-host-ip
curl http://172.16.238.10:5004/

 these steps should help you identify and fix the issue with the Apache service on the Nautilus Application Servers.
