xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer
agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:
1. Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.
2. Create an email account kirsty@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by B4zNgHA7Ya.
3. Set its mail directory to /home/kirsty/Maildir.
4. Install and configure dovecot on the same server.

Ans:-
install and configure postfix

yum install -y postfix

vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

edit /enable settings in main.cf file

myhostname = stratos.xfusioncorp.com

mydomain = xfusioncorp.com

myorigin = $mydomain

inet_interfaces = all

mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain

mynetworks = 172.16.238.17/24, 127.0.0.0/8

home_mailbox = Maildir/

create user
useradd kirsty

passwd kirsty

unix_listener auth-userdb {

mode = 0666

user = postfix

}


service dict {
    unix_listener dict {
      mode = 0600
      user = postfix
      group = postfix
    }
