The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers.
For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository
on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.
a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.
b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.
c. Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repo.
Ans:- 
Here are the steps to configure a local yum repository on the Nautilus Backup Server:

Create the repository configuration file:

Open a terminal on the Nautilus Backup Server.

Create a new repository configuration file in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. You can name it local_yum.repo.
sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo

Add the repository details:
Add the following content to the local_yum.repo file:
[local_yum]
name=Local Yum Repository
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
Save and close the file.
Clean and update yum cache:

Run the following commands to clean and update the yum cache:
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum makecache

Install the vim-enhanced package:
Now, you can install the vim-enhanced package from the newly created local repository:
sudo yum install vim-enhanced

These steps should configure the local yum repository and install the vim-enhanced package successfully.
