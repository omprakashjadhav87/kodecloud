The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems.
One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.
Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry 
about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 5004 on 
all app servers.

Solutions:-

1. At first identify the app server which has issue by running the below commands

$ telnet stapp01 5004  ( check all apps server )

2. login on app server which has connection refuse error & switch to root 
ssh tony@stapp01

3. Run the Below command to check the existing Apache HTTPd service
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

4. With the help of  netstat check which service is using your port and whats is PID.
netstat -tulnp

5. Confirm the PID as per  the netstat output 
ps -ef  |grep sendmail

 kill 615
 
 ps -ef  |grep sendmail
 root       723   674  0 15:08 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto sendmail
 
 6.  Start the httpd service & check the status.
  systemctl start httpd
  systemctl status  httpd
  
  7.  Validate Apache HTTPd running  as per the task request
  telnet stapp01 5004
  
  8.  Click on Finish & Confirm to complete the task successfully
