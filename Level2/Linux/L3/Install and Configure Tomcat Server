The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos
DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:
a. Install tomcat server on App Server 2.

b. Configure it to run on port 6000.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp.


Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e curl http://stapp02:6000

Solutions:- 

🚀 Step 1: Install Tomcat on App Server 2

# Switch to root or use sudo
sudo yum install -y tomcat
If yum doesn't work, you may need to install from Apache binaries manually.

🔧 Step 2: Configure Tomcat to Run on Port 6000
Edit the server.xml file:


sudo vi /etc/tomcat/server.xml
Find this line:

xml
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
Change 8080 to 6000:

xml
<Connector port="6000" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
Save and exit.

📦 Step 3: Deploy ROOT.war from Jump Host
Assuming you have SSH access from Jump Host to App Server 2:

# From Jump Host
scp /tmp/ROOT.war steve@stapp02:/tmp/
Then on App Server 2:


sudo mv /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/
Tomcat will auto-deploy the WAR file as the root application.

🔁 Step 4: Start and Enable Tomcat
bash
sudo systemctl start tomcat
sudo systemctl enable tomcat
✅ Step 5: Verify Deployment
Run this from any host that can reach App Server 2:

curl http://stapp02:6000
You should see the HTML content or response from the deployed app.
