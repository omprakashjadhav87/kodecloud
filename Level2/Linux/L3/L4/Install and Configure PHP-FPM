The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. 
The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

a. Install nginx on app server 2 , configure it to use port 8096 and its document root should be /var/www/html.
b. Install php-fpm version 8.2 on app server 2, it should listen on port 9000.
c. Configure php-fpm and nginx to work together.
d. Once configured correctly, you can test the website using curl http://stapp02:8096/index.php command from jump host. Please note that if the URL is displaying index.php in plain text,
meaning you see <?php etc in the output, it indicates that either PHP-FPM is not installed or Nginx is not properly configured to work with PHP-FPM.

Solutions:- 

ssh tony@stapp02

sudo su -

yum install epel-release

yum install nginx

dnf install -y https://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-9.rpm

dnf module enable php:remi-8.1

yum install php-fpm

vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

File should look like this:

    server {
        listen       8097;
        listen       [::]:8097;
        server_name  _;
        root         /var/www/html;

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.
        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf; -- #Hit enter and paste below block 
		
        location ~ \.php$ {

          try_files $uri = 404;
          include fastcgi_params;
          fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;
          fastcgi_index index.php;     
          fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
         }
        location /
        {
        index  index.php index.html index.htm;
        }
systemctl restart nginx

[root@stapp02 ~]# curl http://stapp02:8097/index.php
