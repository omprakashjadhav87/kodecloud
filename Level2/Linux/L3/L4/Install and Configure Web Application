xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in-progress, 
but we want to get the servers ready. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
a. Install httpd package and dependencies on app server 2.
b. Apache should serve on port 5002.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/beta and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that beta should work on the link http://localhost:5002/beta/ and games 
should work on link http://localhost:5002/games/ on the mentioned app server.
d. Once configured you should be able to access the website using curl command on the respective app server, i.e curl http://localhost:5002/beta/ and curl http://localhost:5002/games/

Solutions:- 

ssh tony@stapp02

sudo su -

yum install openssh-clients -y

yum install -y httpd

cd /etc/httpd/conf

sed -i 47s/80/5002/ httpd.conf

systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

Go back to thor

sudo scp -r /home/thor/beta steve@172.16.238.11:/tmp
sudo scp -r /home/thor/games steve@172.16.238.11:/tmp

Go back to steve, if you are still inside /tmp, run: mv beta gmaes /var/www/html
mv beta games /var/www/html 

cd /var/www/html
