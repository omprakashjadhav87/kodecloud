The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries needs to deploy a new application on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. They have some pre-requites to get ready that server for application deployment. Prepare the server as per requirements shared below:

1. Install and configure nginx on App Server 1.

2. On App Server 1 there is a self signed SSL certificate and key present at location /tmp/nautilus.crt and /tmp/nautilus.key. Move them to some appropriate location and deploy the same in Nginx.
3. Create an index.html file with content Welcome! under Nginx document root.
4. For final testing try to access the App Server 1 link (either hostname or IP) from jump host using curl command. For example curl -Ik https://<app-server-ip>/.

Solutions:-

üîß Nginx SSL Setup (Self-Signed Certificate) on CentOS
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Nginx

sudo yum install -y nginx

2Ô∏è‚É£ Move SSL Certificate & Key
Let‚Äôs move them to a secure, conventional location:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.crt /etc/nginx/ssl/
sudo mv /tmp/nautilus.key /etc/nginx/ssl/

Set appropriate permissions:
sudo chmod 600 /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.*
sudo chown root:root /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.*

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create Document Root & Index Page

echo "Welcome!" | sudo tee /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Nginx for SSL
Creat the SSL server block in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.conf:

vi ssl.conf

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nautilus.key;

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html;
    }
}

5Ô∏è‚É£ Start & Enable Nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

6Ô∏è‚É£ Test from Jump Host
Use the following curl command to verify SSL setup:
curl -Ik https://172.16.238.10/
