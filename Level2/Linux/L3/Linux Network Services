Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 5003 (which is the Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.
Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.
Once fixed, you can test the same using command curl http://stapp01:5003 command from jump host.

Solutions:-
üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Resolution to Make Apache Reachable on Port 5003
1Ô∏è‚É£  From Jump Host: Identify the Problem Server
telnet stapp01 5003
If telnet fails, this means port 5003 is not reachable, so move to the next step.

2Ô∏è‚É£ SSH Into the Problematic App Server
ssh tony@stapp01

3Ô∏è‚É£ Check Apache HTTPD Service Status
systemctl status httpd

Try starting it:
systemctl start httpd

‚ö†Ô∏è If it fails, there may be a port conflict.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Diagnose Port Usage with netstat

netstat -tulnp

Look for any process using port 5003. If it‚Äôs a non-Apache service (e.g., 247/sendemail:ac), you‚Äôll need to kill it:
kill 247

5Ô∏è‚É£ Re-Start Apache HTTPD
Ensure it starts without error.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Apache to Dnsname on Desired IP and Port

Edit Apache config:
vim /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

add this entry server Dnsname 
172.16.238.10:5003

Then restart Apache:
systemctl restart httpd

7Ô∏è‚É£ Open Port 5003 via iptables (Since firewalld Is Unavailable)

restart httpd service 
sudo systemctl restart httpd

üî• Open Port 5003 via iptables (since firewalld isn‚Äôt available)
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5003 -j ACCEPT
service iptables save

Verify the rule was added:
iptables -L -n | grep 5003

8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Validation from Jump Host
Now test from the jump host:
curl http://stapp01:5003
