Nautilus system admin's team is planning to deploy a front end application for their backup utility on Nautilus Backup Server, so that they can manage the backups of different websites from a graphical user interface. They have shared requirements to set up the same; please accomplish the tasks as per detail given below:

a. Install Apache Server on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 5000 port (do not bind it to 127.0.0.1 only, keep it default i.e let Apache listen on server's IP, hostname, localhost, 127.0.0.1 etc).

b. Install Nginx webserver on Nautilus Backup Server and configure it to use 8096.

c. Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy server for Apache.

d. There is a sample index file /home/thor/index.html on Jump Host, copy that file to Apache's document root.

e. Make sure to start Apache and Nginx services.

f. You can test final changes using curl command, e.g curl http://<backup server IP or Hostname>:8096.

Solutions:- 
ðŸ§° Step-by-Step Setup
a. Install Apache and configure it to use port 5000
sudo yum install httpd -y
Edit the Apache ports configuration:

sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Add or modify:
Listen 5000

sudo systemctl restart httpd

b. Install Nginx and configure it to use port 8096
sudo yum install nginx -y   # or dnf

Edit the default Nginx site:
sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

Update the server block:
nginx
server {
    listen 8096;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}

Restart Nginx:
sudo systemctl restart nginx

sudo systemctl enable httpd nginx

From the Jump Host:
scp /home/thor/index.html clint@172.16.238.16:/tmp/

# Then SSH into the backup server
ssh clint@172.16.238.16

# On the backup server
sudo mv /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/

Verify it works
curl http://<backup-server-ip>:8096
