We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 5000 is open for all since
there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with
the following requirements:
1. Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.
2. Block incoming port 5000 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.
3. Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.

Solutions:-
Step 1: Install iptables and Dependencies
On each app host (assuming CentOS/RHEL-based system):
1. At first login on App server  ssh tony@stapp01
2. Switch to  root user : sudo su -
3. Run Below command to install IPtables service 
yum install  -y iptables-services

4. Start & enable the IPtables service below commands
systemctl start iptables && systemctl enable iptables

5. Add below IPtables Rules as per your task ( Please check port no as per your task)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8081 -s 172.16.238.14 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 8081 -j DROP

6. Add below IPtables Rules  for successful task completion 
iptables -L --line-numbers
iptables -R INPUT 5 -p icmp -j REJECT

7.  Finally saved the rules to ensure they remain persistent across reboot
service iptables save 

8.  For persistent across reboot restart IPtables service & validate
systemctl restart iptables && systemctl status iptables

9.  Validate the task by listing Iptables Rules post restart services.

Note :- I have shown only for stapp01. You have to do this in all app server stapp01,stapp02, stapp03. 

10.  Click on Finish & Confirm to complete the task successfully
