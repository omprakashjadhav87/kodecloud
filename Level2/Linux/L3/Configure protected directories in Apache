xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. There are some confidential directories in the document root that need to be 
password protected. Since they are using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. There is a website that needs to 
be uploaded to /var/www/html/devops on Nautilus App Server 3. However, we need to set up the authentication before that.
1. Create /var/www/html/devops direcotry if doesn't exist.
2. Add a user james in htpasswd and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.
3. There is a file /tmp/index.html present on Jump Server. Copy the same to the directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html. 
Also website should work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:8080/devops/

Soutions:- 

üîß Step-by-Step Setup

1. ‚úÖ Create the Directory
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/devops

2. üîê Create the .htpasswd File and Add User
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd james

sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd james
When prompted, enter the password: YchZHRcLkL

3. üõ°Ô∏è Configure .htaccess for Authentication
Create a .htaccess file inside /var/www/html/devops/:
sudo nano /var/www/html/devops/.htaccess

Add the following:

AuthType Basic
AuthName "Restricted Access"
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
Require valid-user

4. üîß Allow .htaccess Overrides in Apache Config
Edit Apache config (usually /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf or a virtual host file):
<Directory "/var/www/html/devops">
    AllowOverride All
</Directory>


Then restart Apache:
sudo systemctl restart httpd

5. üìÅ Copy the Website File
From the Jump Server:
Copy the file to a temporary location:
scp /tmp/index.html banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp/

SSH into the server:
ssh banner@172.16.238.12

Move the file with elevated privileges:
sudo mv /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/devops/

Option 2: Temporarily Change Ownership or Permissions
If you're managing the server and want to allow banner to write directly:
sudo chown banner /var/www/html/devops

Or, more cautiously:
sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html/devops
sudo usermod -aG apache banner  # or www-data, depending on distro
