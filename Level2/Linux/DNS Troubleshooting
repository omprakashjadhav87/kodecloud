The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . 
App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

Ans:-

I can guide you through the process of adding Google public DNS nameservers to App Server 3. Here are the steps:

Access the server: Log in to App Server 3 using SSH or any other method you prefer.

Edit the DNS configuration file: Open the /etc/resolv.conf file in a text editor. You can use nano, vim, or any other editor you are comfortable with. For example, using nano:

sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
Add Google DNS nameservers: Add the following lines to the file to use Google's public DNS servers:

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
Save and exit: Save the changes and exit the text editor. If you are using nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + O to save and Ctrl + X to exit.
