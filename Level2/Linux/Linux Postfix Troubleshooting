Some users of the monitoring app have reported issues with xFusionCorp Industries mail server.
They have a mail server in Stork DC where they are using postfix mail transfer agent. Postfix service seems to fail. Try to identify the root cause and fix it.

Ans:- 
ssh groot@stmail01
sudo su

vi /etc/postfix/main.cf

edit /disbled settings in main.cf file

# inet_interfaces = localhost


systemctl start postfix
systemctl status postfix
