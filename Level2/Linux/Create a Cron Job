The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:



a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.


b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.
Ans:- 

can guide you through the steps to achieve this. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

Step 1: Install cronie package and start crond service
Connect to each Nautilus app server.
Install the cronie package:
sudo yum install -y cronie
Start and enable the crond service:
sudo systemctl start crond
sudo systemctl enable crond
Step 2: Add a cron job for the root user
Open the root user's crontab:
sudo crontab -e
Add the following line to schedule the cron job:
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
Save and exit the editor.
This will create a cron job that runs every 5 minutes and writes "hello" to /tmp/cron_text.
