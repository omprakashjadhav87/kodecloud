We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose.
We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:
Install httpd package on App Server 1 using yum and configure it to run on 5002 port, make sure to start its service.
Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.
Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!
Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:
X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block
X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN
X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff
Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

Ans:- 

I can help you with that! Here are the steps to achieve this:

Install the httpd package and configure it to run on port 5002:
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo sed -i 's/^Listen 80/Listen 5002/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd


Create the index.html file under Apache's default document root (/var/www/html/index.html)

echo "Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!" | sudo tee

Configure Apache to enable the specified headers:

Open the Apache configuration file (usually located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf) and add the following lines:
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
    Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
    Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
</IfModule>

Restart Apache to apply the changes:

Test the headers using curl:

This should display the headers in the response.
