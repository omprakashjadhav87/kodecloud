We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location
in order to understand its content.
On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored at /home/*_key.asc. Use these keys to perform the following actions.
- Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
- Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).
- The user ID you can use is kodekloud@kodekloud.com.

Soluntions:-
Login to the storage server with supper acees.

Encrypting the File
Navigate to the directory where your keys and the file to be encrypted are stored:
cd /home

Encrypt the file using the public key:
 gpg --output encrypted_me.asc --encrypt --recipient kodekloud@kodekloud.com --passphrase kodekloud encrypt_me.txt

Decrypting the File
cd /home

gpg --pinentry-mode loopback --output decrypted_me.txt --decrypt --passphrase kodekloud decrypt_me.asc

passphrase:- 1 

If the command completes successfully, you should find the decrypted content in /home/decrypted_me.txt.

These commands should help you encrypt and decrypt your files securely.
