There is a static website running in Stratos Datacenter. They have already configured the app servers and code is already deployed there. 
To make it work properly, they need to configure LBR server. There are number of options for that, but team has decided to go with HAproxy. FYI, apache is running on port 5001 on all app servers. Complete this task as per below details.
a. Install and configure HAproxy on LBR server using yum only and make sure all app servers are added to HAproxy load balancer. HAproxy must serve on default http port (Note: Please do not remove stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats entry from haproxy default config.).
b. Once done, you can access the website using StaticApp button on the top bar.

Ans:-

I can help you with that! Here are the steps to install and configure HAProxy on the LBR server using yum and ensure all app servers are added to the HAProxy load balancer.

Step 1: Install HAProxy
First, you need to install HAProxy using yum. Open a terminal and run the following command:

sudo yum install haproxy -y

Step 2: Configure HAProxy
Next, you need to configure HAProxy to include your app servers. Edit the HAProxy configuration file located at /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg. You can use any text editor, such as vi.
sudo vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

Step 3: Update HAProxy Configuration

change:

frontend main
  bind *:80
---

backend app
  balance     roundrobin
  server  stapp01 172.16.238.10:5001 check
  server  stapp02 172.16.238.11:5001 check
  server  stapp03 172.16.238.12:5001 check
Step 4: Start and Enable HAProxy
After updating the configuration, start and enable HAProxy to ensure it runs on boot:

sudo systemctl start haproxy
sudo systemctl enable haproxy

Step 5: Verify Configuration
Finally, verify that HAProxy is running and properly configured:

sudo systemctl status haproxy

curl stapp01:5001
curl stapp02:5001
curl stapp03:5001

You should now be able to access the website using the StaticApp button on the top bar.
