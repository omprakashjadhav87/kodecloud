In a bid to automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a new bash script named xfusioncorp.sh. While the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it lacks executable permissions on App Server 3 within the Stratos Datacenter. Your task is to grant executable permissions to the /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 3. Additionally, ensure that all users have the capability to execute it.

Solutions:-

Log in to App Server 3 Use SSH or your preferred method to access the server.

Verify the script exists

ls -l /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Grant executable permissions to all users Run:

chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

chmod 555 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Verify execution manually Try running the script

/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
