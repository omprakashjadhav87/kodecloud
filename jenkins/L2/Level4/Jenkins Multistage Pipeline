The development team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on to develop a new static website and they are planning to deploy the same on Nautilus App Servers using Jenkins pipeline. They have shared their 
requirements with the DevOps team and accordingly we need to create a Jenkins pipeline job. Please find below more details about the task:

Click on the Jenkins button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username admin and password Adm!n321.
Similarly, click on the Gitea button on the top bar to access the Gitea UI. Login using username sarah and password Sarah_pass123.
There is a repository named sarah/web in Gitea that is already cloned on Storage server under /var/www/html directory.
Update the content of the file index.html under the same repository to Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries and push the changes to the origin into the master branch.
Apache is already installed on all app Servers its running on port 8080.
Create a Jenkins pipeline job named deploy-job (it must not be a Multibranch pipeline job) and pipeline should have two stages Deploy and Test ( names are case sensitive ). Configure these stages as per 
details mentioned below.

a. The Deploy stage should deploy the code from web repository under /var/www/html on the Storage Server, as this location is already mounted to the document root /var/www/html of all app servers.
b. The Test stage should just test if the app is working fine and website is accessible. Its up to you how you design this stage to test it out, you can simply add a curl command as well to run a curl 
against the LBR URL (http://stlb01:8091) to see if the website is working or not. Make sure this stage fails in case the website/app is not working or if the Deploy stage fails.
Click on the App button on the top bar to see the latest changes you deployed. Please make sure the required content is loading on the main URL http://stlb01:8091 i.e there should not be a sub-directory 
like http://stlb01:8091/web etc.

Solutions:-
First, I updated manually index.html in Gitea

I installed these Plugins in Jenkins

Search for Pipeline Git, SSH  plugin and click Download now and install after restart

I connected to ststor01

ssh natasha@ststor01

sudo su -

yum install java-17-openjdk -y

[root@ststor01 ~]# cd /var/www/html
[root@ststor01 html]# ls
index.html
[root@ststor01 html]# ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 natasha natasha 4096 Sep  5 09:01 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 natasha natasha 4096 Sep  5 08:59 ..
drwxr-xr-x 8 natasha natasha 4096 Sep  5 09:01 .git

[root@ststor01 html]# cat index.html 
Welcome
[root@ststor01 html]# cat index.html   #check after you run the job in Jenkins
Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries
[root@ststor01 html]# 

I created credentials.
sarah
ststor01

I created a new Node and relaunched it

ststor01
ssh vai connected
home dir / root/
/home/natasha/jenkins

I created a job as pipline

pipeline {
    agent { label 'ststor01' }

    environment {
        GIT_REPO = 'http://git.stratos.xfusioncorp.com/sarah/web.git'
        GIT_BRANCH = 'master'
        GIT_CREDENTIALS_ID = 'GIT_CREDS'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Cloning and deploying the static website...'
                git branch: "${GIT_BRANCH}",
                    credentialsId: "${GIT_CREDENTIALS_ID}",
                    url: "${GIT_REPO}"

                sh '''
                    cd /var/www/html
                    git pull origin master
                '''
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Validating website availability on all app servers and LBR...'
                script {
                    def urls = [
                        'http://stapp01:8080/',
                        'http://stapp02:8080/',
                        'http://stapp03:8080/',
                        'http://stlb01:8091/'
                    ]

                    for (url in urls) {
                        sh """
                            curl -s ${url} | grep -F 'Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries'
                        """
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

âœ… 4. Validate Deployment
Run the pipeline job deploy-job in Jenkins.

click on the app shows: Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries
