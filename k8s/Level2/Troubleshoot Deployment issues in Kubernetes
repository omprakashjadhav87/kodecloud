Last week, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a redis app on Kubernetes cluster, which was working fine so far. This morning one of the team members was making some changes in this existing
setup, but he made some mistakes and the app went down. We need to fix this as soon as possible. Please take a look.
The deployment name is redis-deployment. The pods are not in running state right now, so please look into the issue and fix the same.

Solutions:-

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Check the status of the deployment and pods:

It looks like the issue is related to a missing ConfigMap named "redis-cofig". Here are the steps to resolve this:

Verify the ConfigMap name: Ensure the correct name is "redis-config" and not "redis-cofig". If there's a typo, update the deployment YAML file.

Update the deployment YAML file: If the ConfigMap name was incorrect, update the deployment file and apply the changes:

Restart the Deployment: If you made any changes, restart the deployment:
kubectl rollout restart deployment redis-deployment

Monitor the Pods: Keep an eye on the pods to see if they come up:
kubectl get pods -w

Update the Deployment YAML File:

kubectl edit deployment redis-deployment

and fix the correct image name alpine.
