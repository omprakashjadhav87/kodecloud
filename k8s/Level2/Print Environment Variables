The Nautilus DevOps team is working on to setup some pre-requisites for an application that will send the greetings to different users. There is a sample deployment, that needs to be tested. Below is a scenario which needs to be configured on Kubernetes cluster. 
Please find below more details about it.
Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.
Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:
a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to
b. COMPANY and its value should be Stratos
c. GROUP and its value should be Datacenter
Use command ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"'] (please use this exact command), also set its restartPolicy policy to Never to avoid crash loop back.
You can check the output using kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting command.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Solutions:-
 I can help you with that! Hereâ€™s how you can create and configure the pod on your Kubernetes cluster:

Create a YAML file for the pod configuration. You can name it print-envars-greeting.yaml. Add the following content to the file:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: print-envars-greeting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: print-env-container
    image: bash
    env:
    - name: GREETING
      value: "Welcome to"
    - name: COMPANY
      value: "Stratos"
    - name: GROUP
      value: "Datacenter"
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", 'echo "$(GREETING) $(COMPANY) $(GROUP)"']
  restartPolicy: Never
Apply the YAML file to create the pod:
kubectl apply -f print-envars-greeting.yaml

Check the logs to see the output:
kubectl logs -f print-envars-greeting

This should display the message: Welcome to Stratos Datacenter.
