The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to set up a Jenkins CI server to create/manage some deployment pipelines for some of the projects. 
They want to set up the Jenkins server on Kubernetes cluster. 
Below you can find more details about the task:

1) Create a namespace jenkins

2) Create a Service for jenkins deployment. Service name should be jenkins-service under jenkins namespace, type should be NodePort, nodePort should be 30008
3) Create a Jenkins Deployment under jenkins namespace, It should be name as jenkins-deployment , labels app should be jenkins , container name should be jenkins-container , use jenkins/jenkins image , 
containerPort should be 8080 and replicas count should be 1.
Make sure to wait for the pods to be in running state and make sure you are able to access the Jenkins login screen in the browser before hitting the Check button.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

Solutions:- 

I can help you with that! Here are the steps to deploy Jenkins on a Kubernetes cluster:

Create a namespace for Jenkins:
kubectl create namespace jenkins

Create a Service for the Jenkins deployment:

vi jenkins-service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jenkins-service
  namespace: jenkins
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30008
  selector:
    app: jenkins
-------------
Save this YAML configuration to a file named jenkins-service.yaml and apply it:
kubectl apply -f jenkins-service.yaml

Create a Jenkins Deployment:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: jenkins-deployment
  namespace: jenkins
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: jenkins
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: jenkins
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: jenkins-container
          image: jenkins/jenkins
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
---------------------------------------------
Save this YAML configuration to a file named jenkins-deployment.yaml and apply it:
kubectl apply -f jenkins-deployment.yaml

Wait for the Jenkins pod to be in the running state:
kubectl get pods -n jenkins
Ensure the pod status is Running.

Get the Node IP:
kubectl get nodes -o wide
Look for the EXTERNAL-IP of your node.

Access the Jenkins login screen: Open your browser and navigate to http://<NodeIP>:30008. Replace <NodeIP> with the IP address of your Kubernetes node.
http://<NodeIP>:30008.
