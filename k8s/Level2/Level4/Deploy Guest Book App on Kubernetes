The Nautilus Application development team has finished development of one of the applications and it is ready for deployment. It is a guestbook application that will be used
to manage entries for guests/visitors. As per discussion with the DevOps team, they have finalized the infrastructure that will be deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Below you
can find more details about it.

BACK-END TIER

Create a deployment named redis-master for Redis master.

a.) Replicas count should be 1.

b.) Container name should be master-redis-datacenter and it should use image redis.

c.) Request resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Container port should be redis default port i.e 6379.

Create a service named redis-master for Redis master. Port and targetPort should be Redis default port i.e 6379.

Create another deployment named redis-slave for Redis slave.

a.) Replicas count should be 2.

b.) Container name should be slave-redis-datacenter and it should use gcr.io/google_samples/gb-redisslave:v3 image.

c.) Requests resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Define an environment variable named GET_HOSTS_FROM and its value should be dns.

e.) Container port should be Redis default port i.e 6379.

Create another service named redis-slave. It should use Redis default port i.e 6379.

FRONT END TIER

Create a deployment named frontend.

a.) Replicas count should be 3.

b.) Container name should be php-redis-datacenter and it should use gcr.io/google-samples/gb-frontend@sha256:a908df8486ff66f2c4daa0d3d8a2fa09846a1fc8efd65649c0109695c7c5cbff image.

c.) Request resources as CPU should be 100m and Memory should be 100Mi.

d.) Define an environment variable named as GET_HOSTS_FROM and its value should be dns.

e.) Container port should be 80.

Create a service named frontend. Its type should be NodePort, port should be 80 and its nodePort should be 30009.

Finally, you can check the guestbook app by clicking on App button.


You can use any labels as per your choice.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
